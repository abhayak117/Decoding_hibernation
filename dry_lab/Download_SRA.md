# sratoolkit

## Purpose

sratoolkit helps to download and manipulate raw and compressed squencing data in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) format. It was also used to download our .sra files and convert them to fastq files. 

## Function

the SRA data was first downloaded for each of our samples, then the data was converted to .fastq files for later analysis

## Usage

```prefetch``` downloads the sra for each sample

```fasterq-dump``` coverts each .sra file to a .fastq file for later analysis
